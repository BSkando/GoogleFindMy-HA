# Google Find My Device - Home Assistant Integration

A comprehensive Home Assistant custom integration for Google's Find My Device network, enabling real-time tracking and control of Find My devices directly within Home Assistant.

## Features

- **Real-time Device Tracking**: Track Google Find My devices with fresh GPS location data
- **Advanced Location Filtering**: Intelligent staleness detection and location smoothing to prevent GPS bouncing
- **Configurable Polling**: Flexible polling intervals with rate limit compliance
- **GoogleFindMyTools Integration**: Uses secrets.json from GoogleFindMyTools for authentication

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)
1. Add this repository to HACS as a custom repository
2. Install "Google Find My Device" from HACS
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Add the integration through the UI

### Manual Installation
1. Download this repository
2. Copy the `googlefindmy` folder to `custom_components/`
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Add the integration through the UI

## Configuration

### Authentication Setup
1. Run [GoogleFindMyTools](https://github.com/GoogleFindMyTools/GoogleFindMyTools) on a machine with Chrome
2. Complete the authentication process to generate `Auth/secrets.json`
3. Copy the entire contents of the secrets.json file.  Specifically, open the file in a text editor, select all, and copy.
4. In Home Assistant, paste the copied text from secrets.json when prompted.

## Configuration Options

- **Location Poll Interval**: How often to request fresh location data (default: 5 minutes, minimum: 2 minutes)
- **Device Poll Delay**: Delay between individual device polls (default: 5 seconds)
- **Accuracy Threshold**: Minimum GPS accuracy to accept (default: 100 meters)
- **Movement Threshold**: Minimum movement to detect as actual movement vs. GPS drift (default: 50 meters)
- **Staleness Threshold**: Maximum age of location data to accept (default: 30 minutes)

## Device Tracker Features

### Location Smoothing
The integration includes advanced location smoothing to prevent GPS bouncing:
- Filters out readings with poor accuracy
- Detects micro-movements and treats as stationary
- Locks onto stable locations to prevent constant updates
- Configurable movement and accuracy thresholds

### Services

The integration provides several services:

#### `googlefindmy.locate_device`
Request fresh location data for a specific device.

#### `googlefindmy.play_sound` (currently broken)
Play a sound on a specific device for location assistance.

#### `googlefindmy.locate_device_external`
Alternative location method using external process (workaround for FCM issues).

## Troubleshooting

### No Location Data
- Check if devices have moved recently (Find My devices may not update GPS when stationary)
- Check battery levels (low battery may disable GPS reporting)
- Review logs for staleness warnings

### Stale Location Data
- The integration rejects location data older than 30 minutes
- Move the device or use it actively to trigger fresh GPS readings
- Consider adjusting the staleness threshold if needed

### FCM Connection Problems
- Extended timeout allows up to 60 seconds for device response
- Check firewall settings for Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Review FCM debug logs for connection details

### Rate Limiting
The integration respects Google's rate limits by:
- Sequential device polling (one device at a time)
- Configurable delays between requests
- Minimum poll interval enforcement
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

## Privacy and Security

- All location data uses Google's end-to-end encryption
- Authentication tokens are securely cached
- No location data is transmitted to third parties
- Local processing of all GPS coordinates
